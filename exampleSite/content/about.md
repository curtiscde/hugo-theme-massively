### What are we about?
Well, we're all about about pages. 

Instead of telling you more about a fake company, here's an example of an about page file in the content directory that is referenced by the navigation.toml file in the data folder. 

If you want to link to a page on your hugo blog just make a page like this in the content folder and use a slug like in this markdown file. 

You could theoretically link to exeternal sites from the navigation file in the data directory too!
